2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

# Mathematical solution
solution = 2^4*3^2*5*7*11*13*17*19
# println(solution)
#=
Why is this correct? 
The key observation is that number needs to have all the prime factor that are in every number between 1 and 20.
It is not possible to construct a bigger number with this property than the one below.
