# [Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

## Problem description

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

                  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not
exceed four million.
```

## Solution

As in problem 1, the algorithm to solve the problem is already explained in the description. Most programming languages supports reccusion, so to calculate the nth fibonacci number you can simply do:

```python
def fib(n):
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

However, you need to include the _base case_ when `n` is 1 or 2 to not have an infinite recursion!

With the fibonacci function implemented, all you need to do is to have a while loop to iterate the fibonacci number up to four million and sum all the numbers that are even.

```python
fib_n = 1
n = 1
total = 0
while fib_n <= 4000000:
    fib_n = fib(n)
    if fib_n % 2 == 0:
        total += fib_n
    n += 1
```

The solution mentioned above is however not very efficient. For each call to the `fib` function spawn two new calls to the same function. Hence many values are calculated more than once. This can be solved with _dynamic programming_ or an iterative approach.
