Project Euler Problem 2
=======================

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

                  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not
exceed four million.

function main()
    n0, n1 = 1, 2
    total = 0
    while n1 <= 4000000
        if n1 % 2 == 0
            total += n1
        end
        n0, n1 = n1, n0 + n1
    end

    println(total)
end

main()
