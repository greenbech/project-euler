# [Problem 3: Largest prime factor](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)

## Problem description

```
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
```

## Solution

The first approach you might thinkg about is to divide 600851475143 (from now `N`) by all the integers up to that `N` and see if the rest is zero. Then you will find all the divisors of `N`. The first trick here is that you only need to divide up to the square root of `N`. This if because there cannot be any divisors between `sqrt(N)` and `N` (try to think about that!). However, you now have a new problemâ€”you have to find out which of the divisors that are primes and that approach would not be very efficient.

The more clever approach is to first find the smallest prime factor of `N` and then divide `N` by that number. You can repeat that until `N` is one and the last number you divided by must be the smallest prime factor.
