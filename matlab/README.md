# Solutions in MATLAB/GNU Octave
My Project Euler solutions in the programming language MATLAB/GNU Octave. 

I started doing these tasks as a side project when I had an introduction to programming with MATLAB in the fall of 2015. Since I do not have a MATLAB license anymore, I will only make sure that these solutions run with the open-source alternative [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

## ðŸŽˆUsage
To run a file, simply call
```octave
octave pXXX.m
```
in this folder.
